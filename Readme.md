Digital Thereminvox
====

[Thereminvox(aka theremin,  Ã¦therphone/etherphone, thereminophone 
or termenvox)]() is an pure electronic musical instrument, which 
does not have nor strings, neither buttons. It reacts on *thereminist* hands
positions.

The instrument was invented by Russian electronics engineer and inventor 
[Leon Theremin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9on_Theremin) in 1920.

Here you may find a video where Leon [demonstrates his instrument](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3H5JbkPXpw).

This project is written in memory of Leon Theremin, almost 100 years after his invention.

The project is digital implementation of a similar idea.

Palms positions are detected by two VL53L1X sensors and then converted into sound.
